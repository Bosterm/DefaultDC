# DefaultDC
Omeka Plugin that allows administrators to specify default values for Dublin Core fields.  Dublin Core fields are then auto-filled with default values when records are created or edited.

## Notes

When a record is added or edited, if a default Dublin Core value has been configured and that specific field is blank, the default value will be inserted into the form field.  The value is then saved when the record is saved.
